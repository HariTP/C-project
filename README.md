# C-project

Our project titled ‘SIMPLE FOOD ORDERING SYSTEM’ is about various digital work that needs to be accomplished so as to ensure smooth working of an eatery or restaurant. 
We have got overall functions described in the project i.e- ORDER ,
SERVING , ORDER STATUS.
Order function allows the user to enter whatever item they want to order
from the given menu. It also allows the user to choose from various
quantities of servings they require.
Serve function allows the restaurant to cross check the statistics for the
business on the day.
Order status function helps to keep track of the orders received. It shows
which order is being prepared along with the number of orders pending and
completed.
